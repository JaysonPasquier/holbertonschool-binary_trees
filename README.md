## Description
This project implements various operations and functions for binary trees in C. It includes creation, manipulation, traversal, and analysis of binary tree structures.
## Files and Functions

binary_tree_node: Creates a binary tree node.
- 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c
  binary_tree_insert_left: Inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
- 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c
binary_tree_insert_right: Inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
- 3-binary_tree_delete.c
binary_tree_delete: Deletes an entire binary tree.
- 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c
binary_tree_is_leaf: Checks if a node is a leaf.

## Compilation
To compile the project, use:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o binary_trees
```
## Usage
Include the binary_trees.h header in your C files and link with the compiled object files.
